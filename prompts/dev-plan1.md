# Comprehensive Development Plan

Overview

You will build a small business management system using React (with Vite), Chakra UI, and Firebase. The system will support a single user or a small set of whitelisted users to manage customers, orders, products, job descriptions, prices, special offers, and reports. The final product should be secure, responsive (mobile-first), and intuitive, emphasizing minimal clicks and smooth navigation.

High-Level Objectives

	1.	Authentication & Authorization:
	•	Implement Google Sign-In with Firebase Authentication.
	•	Whitelist-based access control (only certain emails can log in).
	•	If a user is not whitelisted, show an error message and deny access.
	2.	Core Data Management (Firestore):
	•	Collections for: users, customers, jobDescriptions, products, prices, orders, specialOffers.
	•	Ensure proper indexing, security rules, and potentially Cloud Functions for complex logic.
	3.	UI & UX:
	•	Mobile-first design with a top header and a horizontal tab bar for navigation (Customers, Orders, Products, Job Descriptions, Offers, Reports).
	•	Minimalist design, using a blue-grey color scheme, large font sizes, and Chakra UI for consistent styling.
	•	Responsive layout: single-column on mobile, and adapt to a wider layout for desktops.
	4.	Features:
	•	Customers: View, search, filter, add, edit, display contacts and addresses.
	•	Orders: Create and edit orders with chosen customers, job descriptions, products, and automatically fetched prices. Apply special offers when available.
	•	Products & Job Descriptions: CRUD operations, active/inactive toggling, usage in pricing and orders.
	•	Prices: Manage pricing for customer-job-product combinations, with the ability to add new prices if unknown.
	•	Special Offers: Create and manage time-bound discounts and apply them to specific customers.
	•	Reports: Generate filterable reports with charts, and export to PDF/CSV.
	5.	Security & Performance:
	•	Enforce Firestore security rules so only authenticated, whitelisted users read/write.
	•	Implement indexing, efficient queries, caching, and potential offline support for better performance.
	6.	Testing & Deployment:
	•	Develop locally with Firebase emulators.
	•	Deploy via firebase deploy.
	•	Consider adding basic unit and integration tests for critical functionality.

Step-by-Step Development Plan

Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication

Goals:
	•	Set up the project structure and development environment.
	•	Implement authentication with whitelist verification.

Tasks:
	1.	Setup Project:
	•	Initialize a new Firebase project.
	•	Configure the frontend directory with Vite and React.
	•	Install Chakra UI, Firebase SDK, and any necessary libraries (e.g., React Router if needed).
	2.	Firebase Configuration:
	•	Create a firebase.js file that initializes Firebase (project config, auth, firestore references).
	•	Set up Firebase Authentication with the Google provider.
	3.	Authentication Flow:
	•	Implement a Login.jsx component:
	•	Display a “Sign in with Google” button.
	•	On success, check if the user’s email is in the whitelist (a users collection with whitelisted: true).
	•	If not whitelisted, show an error message and log them out.
	4.	Routing & Protected Routes:
	•	Implement a basic routing setup (e.g., /login and /app).
	•	If authenticated and whitelisted, redirect to /app.
	•	If not, show login or error.
	5.	Security & Firestore Rules:
	•	Write initial Firestore rules (firestore.rules) to ensure only logged-in and whitelisted users can read/write data.
	•	Deploy these rules and test with the emulator.

Deliverables:
	•	A working login screen that authenticates with Google and enforces whitelist logic.
	•	Basic project scaffold with proper file structure and Firebase initialized.

Phase 2: UI Layout & Navigation

Goals:
	•	Establish the global UI structure.
	•	Implement the header, tabs, and responsiveness.

Tasks:
	1.	Global Layout:
	•	Create a Header component with the app title or logo on the left and user avatar/menu on the right.
	•	Insert a horizontal tab bar under the header to navigate between:
	•	Customers
	•	Orders
	•	Products
	•	Job Descriptions
	•	Offers
	•	Reports
	2.	Responsive Design:
	•	Use Chakra UI’s responsive props to ensure the layout scales from mobile to desktop.
	•	Mobile-first: single-column, vertical scrolling. On wider screens, increase padding/margins.
	3.	Color & Typography Setup:
	•	Create a Chakra UI theme with a blue-grey accent color.
	•	Set base font size and ensure readable line-height.
	•	Test on a mobile viewport to ensure the layout is clear and accessible.
