# General orientation:
Use shadcn/ui, React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS to create the application
note: the 
1. `firebase.json` configuration file resides in the project’s root directory
2.You will use firebase as host!
3. the main codebase is located in the `./src` folder. 
4. All required npm modules will be installed at the project’s root `./node_modules`
5. and the build system is `vite`. 
The application’s structure must fully integrate these technologies and adhere to this project layout for consistency and maintainability.
